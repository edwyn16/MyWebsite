                My name is Edwyn R. Jones and I'm 19 years old. I was born on of island St. Maarten. <br>
                It was there, at a very young age that I developed the curiosity of how a computer actually worked. <br>
                When I was ten my mother moved to the Netherlands and I have been living here ever since. <br><br>

                One might ask why the interest in computers? <br><br>

                Here's the thing, St.Maarten was not technologically developed back then. Therefore, moving to the Netherdlands gave me a whole new perspective of technology. <br>
                So here I am today pursuing my dream to become a Softeware Engineer. <br>
